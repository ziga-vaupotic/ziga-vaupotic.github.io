Hyperviscosity has recently emerged as a promising stabilisation method for hyperbolic
partial differential equations. The method introduces a high-order Laplacian term to dampen the
spurious modes that would otherwise lead to divergence of the solution. The use of a higher-order
operator reduces the numerical degradation of the solution compared to a simple artificial viscosity
scheme, but poses a more difficult computational problem. To reduce the numerical complexity and
the effect of the unbalanced boundary stencils, we can use different approximation approaches for the
core equation and the stabilisation term. In this presentation, we will investigate how various RBF-
based approximation methods for the hyperviscosity operator and their parameterizations affect
stability and accuracy. We will also investigate to what extent the recommended parameterization
can be stretched without compromising the stabilisation properties.
