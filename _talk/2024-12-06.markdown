The numerical stability of fluid flow is an important topic in computational fluid
dynamics as fluid flow simulations usually become numerically unstable in the
turbulent regime. Many mesh-based methods have already established numerical
dissipation procedures that dampen the effects of the unstable advection term. When
it comes to meshless methods, the prominent stabilization scheme is hyperviscosity.
It introduces numerical dissipation in the form of a higher order Laplacian operator.
Many papers have already discussed the general effects of hyperviscosity and its
parameters. However, hyperviscosity in flow problems has not yet been analysed in
depth. In this paper, we discuss the effects of hyperviscosity on natural convection
flow problems in the turbulent regime.
