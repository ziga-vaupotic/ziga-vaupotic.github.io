## Abstract

The numerical stability of fluid flow is an important topic in computational fluid dynamics as fluid flow simulations usually become numerically unstable in the turbulent regime. Many mesh-based methods have already established numerical dissipation procedures that dampen the effects of the unstable advection term. When it comes to meshless methods, the prominent stabilisation scheme is hyperviscosity. It introduces numerical dissipation in the form of a higher-order Laplacian operator. Many papers have already discussed the general effects of hyperviscosity and its parameters. However, hyperviscosity in flow problems has not yet been analyzed in depth. In this paper, we discuss the effects of hyperviscosity on natural convection flow problems as we approach the turbulent regime.
