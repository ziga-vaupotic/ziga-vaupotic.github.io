## Abstract

This research paper focuses on analyzing the potential use of natural convection as an alternative
or primary method for temperature control in polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR is used to
amplify copies of DNA and is considered to be one of the most important processes of molecular
biology. Computational fluid dynamics(CFD) simulations will be used to model and analyze the
thermal behavior of PCR systems. The usage of such methods is a great alternative to experimental
data. The research seeks to understand the temperature distribution in the natural convection PCR
system. Hence, provide a great insight into the yet unclear connection between natural convection
and PCR efficiency. The results will have many applications, such as enhancing the efficiency,
efficacy and performance of PCR machines
